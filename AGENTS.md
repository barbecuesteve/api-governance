The purpose of this repository is to create and host a series of papers regarding API governance:

1. An [executive summary](exec-summary.md), making the argument to the CEO and the board to invest in this
2. A [leadership-level description](README.md), including both technical and organizational elements of the process
3. A [detailed technical description](technical-design.md) of the technology parts.
4. Two [implementation plans]:
    - for [building from scratch](build-from-scratch/README.md)
    - for [building from composition](build-from-composition/README.md)
